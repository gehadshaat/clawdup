    "title": "Add unit and integration tests with Vitest",
    "description": "The project has zero test coverage. Add Vitest and write tests for core modules: clickup-api.ts (mock fetch, test slugify/formatTaskForClaude), config.ts (env loading priority), git-ops.ts (mock execFile, retry logic), claude-worker.ts (prompt construction, needs-input detection), runner.ts (state machine, orphan recovery). Target 80%+ line coverage."

    "title": "Add webhook support as alternative to polling",
    "description": "Currently clawup polls every 30s. Add an optional webhook HTTP server mode (--webhook-port) that listens for ClickUp taskStatusUpdated events for instant task pickup. Keep polling as fallback with longer interval when webhooks are active."

  {
    "title": "Add task filters for scoped automation",
    "description": "Add TASK_TAGS env var to only process tasks with specific tags, TASK_PRIORITY to filter by minimum priority level, and MAX_TASKS_PER_RUN to limit tasks per polling cycle. This gives teams control over which tasks get auto-implemented."

  {
    "title": "Add plugin/hook system for extensibility",
    "description": "Add lifecycle hooks (beforeProcess, afterProcess, onSuccess, onFailure, beforeMerge) as async functions in clawup.config.mjs. This enables Slack notifications, custom PR templates, CI check verification before merge, etc."
