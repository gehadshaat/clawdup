# Publishes the package to NPM when a GitHub release is created.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. Create an NPM access token (Automation type recommended)
#   2. Add it as a repository secret named NPM_TOKEN
#
# Typical flow:
#   Run the "Release" workflow (release.yml) which bumps the version,
#   creates a git tag, and publishes a GitHub release — triggering this workflow.
#
# The workflow validates that the package.json version matches the release tag,
# builds the project, and publishes to NPM.
